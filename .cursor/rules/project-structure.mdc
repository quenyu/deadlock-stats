# Project Structure Guide

This project follows a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend directories.

## Frontend Structure (Feature-Sliced Design)
The frontend follows Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture with the following layers:
- `app/` - Application initialization, providers, global styles
- `pages/` - Compositional layer, routing
- `widgets/` - Complex composite components (e.g., forms, widgets)
- `features/` - User interactions, business processes
- `entities/` - Business entities (models, components)
- `shared/` - Reusable infrastructure code

## Backend Structure (Clean Architecture)
The backend follows Clean Architecture principles:
- `handlers/` - HTTP request handlers
- `services/` - Business logic layer
- `repositories/` - Data access layer
- `models/` - Domain models
- `config/` - Configuration
- `middleware/` - HTTP middleware

## Infrastructure
- `docker/` - Docker configuration files
- `nginx/` - Nginx configuration
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configuration
